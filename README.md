# About
Mini Project For Sc1015 Regarding Heart Disease And Prediction Dataset 

# Contributor
1. @bensee454 - Logistic Regression, Data Resampling
2. @halterdevil - Random Forest, Data Visualization, Data Extraction
3. @LsEkOy - Decision Tree, Data Cleaning
# Problem Definition
1. How can people reduce their risk or exposure towards heart disease?
2. How different variable affect getting Heart Disease?

# Models Used
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forest

# Conclusion
1. Cholesterol and FastingBS have low linear correlation value with Heart Disease
2. Oldpeak, Age, MaxHR and RestingBP have higher linear correlation value with Heart Disease
3. Cleaning data improved model performance
4. Random Forest method consistently did better in predicting Heart Disease (around 80-83% accuracy)
5. Yes, it is possible to predict if heart disease with acceptable amount of accuracy

# What did we learn from this project?
1. Decision Tree
